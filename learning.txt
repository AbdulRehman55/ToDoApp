import react {useSate}

const [inputtext,setinputtext]=usestate('');

every piece of state that you have data and react automatically updates to everything as long as you use in different places


useEffect:
it allows us to run a function basically whenever a piece of state changes

method:
arrow fucntion, [here we speciffy how many times or when];

when we dont specify how many times then it only runs once

UI and react updates based on state


local storage and usestate concept needs to improve
